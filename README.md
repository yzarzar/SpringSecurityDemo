# Spring Boot JWT Authentication Project

Welcome to the **Spring Boot JWT Authentication Project**. This project demonstrates how to implement authentication in a Spring Boot application using **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**. The application features essential components for managing authentication, including custom entry points, token filters, and login request/response handling.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

- **`AuthEntryPointJwt.java`**: 
  - Handles unauthorized access and sends appropriate error responses.
  
- **`AuthTokenFilter.java`**: 
  - Filters incoming HTTP requests, validating JWT tokens and setting the authentication context.

- **`LoginRequest.java`**: 
  - Encapsulates the login request data, typically including username and password.

- **`LoginResponse.java`**: 
  - Defines the response sent back to the client upon successful authentication, usually containing the JWT token and user details.
